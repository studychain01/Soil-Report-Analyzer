This repository now includes a simple chatbot built with Streamlit and the OpenAI API.

## Running the Chatbot

1. Install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set your OpenAI API key and launch the Streamlit app:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key" streamlit run chatbot_app.py
```

The app will open in your browser and allow you to chat with the model.
